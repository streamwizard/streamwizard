/**
 * Twitch presentation assets for overlay widgets.
 *
 * Widgets can't call Helix — no credentials, and the iframe CSP blocks the
 * origin — so everything they need to turn an EventSub id into a picture comes
 * through here, via /api/twitch/* on the overlay origin.
 *
 * The split that matters:
 *   assets.ts — cached in Supabase with a TTL. Stale = an old picture.
 *   live.ts   — never cached. Stale = a wrong number on screen.
