 * Reports `section_viewed` once per mount when a section has been meaningfully

 * the viewport. Wrap a section's content in it; it renders a plain <div> that
 * does not change layout.
 *
 * The point is the scroll funnel: which sections a visitor reached before
 * they clicked (or did not click) Connect Twitch. `$pageleave` already carries
 * max scroll percentage, but a percentage does not say which section it was.
