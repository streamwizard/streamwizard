# Contributing to StreamWizard

Never opened a PR before? Never forked a repo? That's fine — this guide covers everything from zero. Read it top to bottom once, then use it as a reference.

Got stuck? [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/29Eq659egv) and ask. No question is too basic.

## 1. What you need installed

| Tool | What it does | Install |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | Tracks code changes | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| [Bun](https://bun.sh/) | Runs the project | [bun.sh/docs/installation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) |
| [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) | Manages the local database | [supabase.com/docs/guides/cli](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | Required by Supabase CLI | [docs.docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) | To submit changes | [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) |

Check what's already installed by running these in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
bun --version
supabase --version
docker --version
```

Version number = good. Error = install it.

## 2. How the project is structured

StreamWizard is a **monorepo** — one repo, multiple apps and shared packages. You probably only need to touch one of these.

```
streamwizard-backend/
├── apps/
│   ├── rest-api/          # Main API (Hono)
│   ├── streamwizard-bot/  # Processes Twitch events
│   ├── ws-server/         # WebSocket server
│   ├── smp-bridge/        # Twitch ↔ Minecraft integration
│   ├── discord-bot/       # Discord bot
│   ├── clip-sync/         # Syncs Twitch clips
│   ├── web-streamwizard/  # Main web app
│   ├── web-overlay/       # Twitch overlay
│   └── web-monitor/       # Monitoring dashboard
└── packages/
    ├── supabase/          # Database client and generated types
    ├── twitch-api/        # Twitch API client
    ├── types/             # Shared TypeScript types
    ├── schemas/           # Zod validation schemas
    ├── logger/            # Logging utilities
    └── ui/                # Shared UI components
```

The monorepo is managed with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/), which lets you run commands across all apps at once.

## 3. Fork and clone the repo

**Forking** creates your own copy of the repo on GitHub. You make changes there, then propose them back here.

### Step 1 — Fork

1. Go to [github.com/streamwizard/streamwizard-backend](https://github.com/streamwizard/streamwizard-backend)
2. Click **Fork** in the top-right
3. Click **Create fork**

### Step 2 — Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/streamwizard-backend.git
cd streamwizard-backend
```

### Step 3 — Add the original repo as upstream

This lets you pull in updates from the main project later:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/streamwizard/streamwizard-backend.git
```

Verify it worked:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the original).

### Step 4 — Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Step 5 — Environment variables

The project uses [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) for secrets in production. Locally, you use a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You don't need every variable — only the ones relevant to what you're working on. Not sure which ones? Ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/29Eq659egv).

## 4. Set up your local database

StreamWizard uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for its database. For local development you run a **local Supabase instance** — you never touch staging or production.

### Step 1 — Start the local stack

Make sure Docker is running, then:

```bash
supabase start
```

First run takes a few minutes. When it's ready you'll see:

```
API URL:    http://127.0.0.1:54321
DB URL:     postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
```

### Step 2 — Apply existing migrations

```bash
supabase db push --local
```

### Step 3 — Open Supabase Studio

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:54323](http://127.0.0.1:54323) — it's a visual interface for your local database. Use it to explore tables, run queries, and test changes.

### Step 4 — Making database changes

If your change needs a new table, column, or function:

1. Make the change in Supabase Studio locally and verify it works
2. Generate a migration file:

```bash
supabase db diff -f your_migration_name
```

This creates a file in `supabase/migrations/`. **Commit it** — that's how the change gets applied to staging and production automatically through the CI pipeline.

### Step 5 — Stop when done

```bash
supabase stop
```

---

## 5. Make your changes

### Step 1 — Sync with staging

Before touching any code, pull in the latest changes:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout staging
git merge upstream/staging
```

### Step 2 — Create a branch

Never work directly on `staging` or `main`. Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Good branch names:
- `feature/add-clip-sorting`
- `fix/ws-server-reconnect`
- `docs/update-readme`

### Step 3 — Commit your changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add clip sorting by view count"
```

Commit message prefixes:
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `chore:` — maintenance, dependencies

### Step 4 — Push to your fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 6. Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub: `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/streamwizard-backend`
2. Click **Compare & pull request**
3. **Set the base branch to `staging` — not `main`**

   > PRs against `main` won't be accepted. Always target `staging`.

4. Fill in the PR description:
   - What does this change do?
   - Why is it needed?
   - How did you test it? Include screenshots for UI changes.

5. Click **Create pull request**

---

## 7. The review process

1. A maintainer reviews your code and may leave comments
2. Make changes on your branch and push — the PR updates automatically
3. Once approved, it gets merged into `staging`
4. The staging database migration pipeline runs automatically
5. After verification on staging, changes go to `main` and hit production

Reviews can take a few days. If you haven't heard back in a week, leave a comment on the PR.

---

## 8. Branch rules

| Branch | Purpose | Who can PR here |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `staging` | Pre-production — tested before going live | Anyone via a fork |
| `main` | Verified — triggers database migrations | Maintainers only |
| `production` | Production — what real users see | Automated only |

The `production` branch is never touched manually. When migrations on `main` succeed, it gets updated automatically and Dokploy deploys from there.

---

## 9. Code style

Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
bun format       # auto-formats your code
bun lint         # checks for issues
bun check-types  # validates TypeScript types
```

PRs with failing checks won't be merged.
